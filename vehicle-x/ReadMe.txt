Your job is to perform fine-grained classification (1,362 class) in VehicleX dataset using a neural network.

In ass 1, you are provided with features extracted from ResNet which is pretrained on ImageNet. 

The labeling format for vehicleX data is "id_cam_num.npy". Each ".npy" file contains a single feature vector.

Taking "0001_c001_33.npy" as an example:

0001 means the vehicle id is 0001
c001 means the camera id is 001
33 is the counting number

We also provide detailed labeling include vehicle orientation, light intensity, light direction, camera distance, 
camera height, vehicle type and vehicle color in the XML file. The detailed labeling allows multi-task learning.

Content in the directory:
1. "train/" contains 45,438 images for training, "val/" contains 14,936 images for validation and "test/" contains 15,142 images for testing.
2. "finegrained_label.xml". It lists the detailed labels for the whole dataset. Lighting and camera labels are Unity parameters.
